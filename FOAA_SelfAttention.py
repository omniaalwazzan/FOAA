Initially, we experimented with multihead attention in our code, but it's quite time-consuming and its imporovment was marginal. Therefore, I am opting to configure this code to accommodate both multihead and single head attention mechanisms.
We were only able to utilize 64 heads (feature dim) to align with the behavior of MOAB. This constraint may be one of the limitations of MOAB that we plan to tackle in the future. 
Additionally, while there are simpler methods for implementing attention, we favor explicit coding for its clarity and ease of comprehension.
