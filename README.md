### The paper has been accepted by The IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) and will be available soon.

This paper serves as an extension to our previous methodology, MOAB. Here, we introduce a novel approach where the MOAB block is integrated into the attention mechanism, replacing the standard dot product operation between Query and Key in a cross-attention manner for multimodality fusion. For more comprehensive insights, please refer to the paper.
This repository provides all functional fusion methods that can be applied to any domain with any CNN
